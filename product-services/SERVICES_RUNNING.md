## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Frontend Can't Connect to Backend:**

1. **Check if all backend services are running:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :9010  # User Service
   lsof -i :9011  # Product Service
   lsof -i :9012  # Merchant Service
   lsof -i :9013  # Order Service
   ```

2. **Check .env file:**
   Make sure `/Users/trishiry/ecommerce-frontend/.env` has:
   ```env
   VITE_USER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9010
   VITE_PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9011
   VITE_MERCHANT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9012
   VITE_CHECKOUT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:9013
   ```

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

### **If Services Won't Start:**

1. **Check if ports are in use:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :9010
   lsof -i :9011
   lsof -i :9012
   lsof -i :9013
   ```

2. **Kill processes on ports:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:9010 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:9011 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:9012 | xargs kill -9
   lsof -ti:9013 | xargs kill -9
   ```

3. **Check MySQL is running:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -proot@123 -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
   ```

4. **Check MongoDB is running:**
   ```bash
   mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
   ```

### **If Database Errors:**

1. **Recreate databases:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -proot@123 -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS user_service; CREATE DATABASE user_service;"
   mysql -u root -proot@123 -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS checkout_service; CREATE DATABASE checkout_service;"
   mysql -u root -proot@123 -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS merchants; CREATE DATABASE merchants;"
   ```

## üéä **SUCCESS!**

Your ecommerce platform is now **fully operational**! All services are running and communicating with each other.

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Test the platform** using the checklist above
2. **If everything works**, consider implementing the improvements in `QUICK_WINS.md` to make it look like Amazon
3. **If you find issues**, check the troubleshooting section above

## üìù **IMPORTANT NOTES**

1. **Frontend Port**: The frontend is running on port **5175** (not 5173). This is because ports 5173 and 5174 were already in use.

   **‚ö†Ô∏è CORS ISSUE**: The backend Order Service is configured for port 5173. If you encounter CORS errors when checking out or viewing orders, you have two options:

   **Option A (Quick Fix)**: Stop the frontend and restart it to get port 5173:
   ```bash
   # In the frontend terminal (Terminal 52), press Ctrl+C
   # Then kill any process on port 5173:
   lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
   # Restart frontend:
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Option B (Update CORS)**: Update the Order Service CORS configuration to allow port 5175:
   - Edit: `/Users/trishiry/Downloads/order-service/src/main/groovy/com/ecommerce/cart_order_service/Controller/OrderController.java`
   - Change line 16 from: `@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:5173")`
   - To: `@CrossOrigin(origins = {"http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:5175"})`
   - Restart Order Service

2. **Java Version**: All backend services are running with Java 21. Make sure you have Java 21 installed.

3. **Databases**: Make sure MySQL and MongoDB are running before starting the services.

4. **Environment Variables**: The frontend uses Vite environment variables (VITE_*) which are loaded from the `.env` file.
